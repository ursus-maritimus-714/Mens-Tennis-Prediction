    "In the previous workbook (02_Data_Cleaning_Wrangling_ClayCourt), raw data were imported, clean and expanded upon. In this workbook, an extensive set of features is developed from the raw data (currently years 2009-2019). At a high level:\n",
    "* Target feature created per match to be predicted on (% total points won per player in match to be predicted on)\n",
    "* For each match to be predicted on, to assess long-term player performance as a predictor of performance in the next match under similar conditions, mean match stats-derived features from previous matches are accrued over the 60 matches previous to the match being predicted on. \n",
    "    * This accrual is surface-specific (hard or clay courts, with addtional features sensitive to indoor or outdoor match status) \n",
    "    * These past 60-match features are also decay weighted, such that matches occuring closer in time to the match being predicted on are weighted more than matches occuring less recently in time relative to the match being predicted on. Both the 60 match horizon, as well as the specific decay-weighting employed presently, have been derived (\"optimized\") empiricaly based on feedback from model performance with different parameters \n",
    "    * Decay-weighted past perfomance features (over the last 60 surface matches relative to a given match to be predicted on) have also been adjusted based on the relatively strong or weak past performance of the opponents faced during that 60 match stretch relative to a theoretical schedule of opponents of average past performance. \n",
    "        * This \"Strength of Schedule\" weighting makes a substantial improvement to prediction accuracy (I've determined this from running models with and without such adjustment). \n",
    "        * This weghting is also done with respect to time-decay weighting, ie opponent strength computation is subject to the same time decay weighting relative to the match being predicted on as the player's own performance being adjusted was\n",
    "* Apart from performance-based features, another set of features generated here deals with player stamina (derived from number of past matches played) and fatigue (points or minutes spent on court thus far in a given tournament). Stamina and fatigue are integrated into one \"body battery\" metric as well, which I've shown has more predictive value than considering fatigue or stamina in isolation. \n",
    "    * As with engineered performance features, fatigue features are fitted with empirically-derived, time decay-weighted curves\n",
    "* A number of other features are derived in this workbook, including on topics including head-to-head past performance between two players in a given match to be predicted on, handedness, height, \"home court advantage\" and court speed estimation (based on the past year's aggregate ace performance at the same tournament) and potential effects relative to individual player profiles\n",
    "* All player-level features generated in this workbook are formulated both in a \"raw\" version (ie, without respect to the opponent in the match to be predicted on) and a \"differential\" version (ie, WITH respect to the opponent in the match to be predicted on). Modeling shows that the differential versions of the features are MUCH more predictive than the raw versions. Though including the raw versions as well does yield a slight improvement in target feature prediction.\n",
    "* Currently, a data inclusion date range of 2009-2019 is delimited (this has been shaped by feedback from EDA and modeling), and matches played on grass (too low a sample size; also removed Davis up and Olympics matches for same reason as well as for their \"odd\" contexts) and matches where one player withdrew (usually for injury reason) either before the match or early on in the match were filtered out and NOT included in feature generation. Critically, matches filtered out beyond this point (see EDA and Modeling workbooks) WERE used for initial feature generation/accrual.\n",
    "    * For modeling clay court tennis specifically, where the sample is much smaller (by ~3-4x) over the same time frame as for hard court tennis, the sample has been expanded over 3 additional years (2009-2019) as compared to the hard court model. See reporting from the original Tennis Prediction Project for detailed analyses and discussion of this dichotomy. \n",
    "* A final general statement that is important to make is that pains are taken throughout to avoid \"data leakage\", which is to say to avoid incorporating into predictive features any information that would not have been available prior to the time a given match being predicted on was played.

    "converting briefly back to by-match organization so that we can obtain the data we need to compute player \"Strength of Schedule\" at the time of each match to be predicted on, across a range of features. The concept is the same as you might seen in football or soccer analytics. At the time of every match to be predicted on, we have a number of (mostly time-decay weighted) assessments of how the player performed over the last stretch of time (60 matches) on the same surface as the match to be played. However, we want to normalize these predictive features by the aggregate strength of the schedule of opponents they faced in the stretch over which those features were generated. For example, winning 60% of your serve points against a schedule of opponents who had historically yielded 65% of opponent serve points (ie, their own return points) is not as impressive as winning 60% of your serve points against a schedule of opponents who had historically yielded 55% of opponent serve points (ie, their own return points)."

    "For now, we will use ace% per given tournament from the previous year (when available) as a proxy for court speed. Conditions, of course, are dictated by a number of factors, including the balls, altitude, watering frequency (clay) and sand incorporation in the mix for hard courts. Also, indoor conditions tend to be faster than outdoor. This is challenging to model because all conditions variables are seldom the same from year to year at a given venue. Plus, even the weather at the time of a match will make a considerable difference in court conditions, possibly even greater than the underlying \"weather neutral\" conditions. "
