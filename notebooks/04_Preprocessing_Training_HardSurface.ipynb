    "The goal of this stage is to create a training-testing split in the predictive features and target feature (% total points won by a given player in a given match), and to create a few simple benchmark models against which the more complex models will be compared in terms of prediction accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction is to be carried out at the player level for a given match (so each match in the sample has two records associated with it). Performance features used for prediction of a given player's % pts won in a given match are accrued based on  surface-specific (with a few exceptions) match data in matches PRIOR TO BUT NOT INCLDING the match being predicted nor any subsequent matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "The large majority of features included in the modeling stage are \"differential\", meaning that their values result from subtraction of previously calculated values for each of the two players in the match being predicted (Player X - Player Y or Player Y - Player X). As a simple example (actual features are typically adjusted in a number of ways before this stage) if Player X won 55% of his previous service points and his opponent (Player Y) won 47% of his own serve points the \"differential\" feature value \"player_past_service_pts_diff\" for Player X would be 55 - 47 = 8% and for Player Y would be 47 - 55 = -8%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of prevous modeling iterations, data from the years 2015-2019 are currently included in the hard court-specific model, with an additional prior 3 years (2012-2014) used in statistical accrual for feature generation. Also, a threshold of minimum of 20 prior matches for BOTH players in a given match to be predicted is employed. Not surprisingly, prediction accuracy is sensitive to the amount of data available to generate predictive features, as well as to the amount of data available to train and test the model. Critically, matches filtered out at the current point and beyond (ie, during modeling) WERE used during statistical accruals for feature generation. Also of note, matches which lasted fewer than 12 games were filtered out BEFORE statistical accruals for feature generation. \n",

    "Four simple linear benchmarking models are created below:\n",
    "* 1) A \"dummy\" model, which simply uses the mean of the training data split to predict the target of % points won by a given player in a given match\n",
    "* 2) A multivariate linear model that uses as predictive features only 1- difference in ranking between the two players, 2- difference in log of the rankings of the two players, and 3- difference in rankings points between the two players. Given that tournament entry and seeding are determined primarily by ranking data by the tour itself, this simple model can very prudently be seen as a fair benchmark for any system hoping to predict player performance on a move-forward basis.\n",
    "* 3) A univariate linear model using implied win probabilities (IWPs) derived from aggregate closing wagering lines from a number of reputable sportsbooks (exact books aggregate vary by specific match) as predictive features. \n",
    "* 4) A univariate linear model using IWPs derived only from Pinnacle Sports' closing wagering lines as predictive features. Pinnacle is considered to be one of the \"sharpest\" sportsbook, with closing lines typically being highly efficient.\n",
    "* 5) A univariate linear model using only Opening Line data from Pinnacle Sports (via Oddsportal). Though not as efficent as the closing lines, which reflect the sum total of the \"wisdom of the markets\" (including insider info) right up to match time, these lines are still quite efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "All historical wagering lines data from which IWPs were derived were obtained, either directly or indirectly (via Dan Weston [http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php]), from Oddsportal (https://www.oddsportal.com/results/#tennis).\n",
    "* As a technical note, to derive IWPs from wagering lines the \"vig\" (ie, house edge) must be removed from the lines first. I followed well established methods for acheiving this (see Workbook 1 for code, reference and description). "

    "The Dummy Model above is the ultimate straw man (we sure hope we can beat guessing with the average with all of the great data we have!). A slightly more fair comparison to our ultimate feature-rich model is a Linear Model based simply on the past match data provided by the ATP, namely player ranking and player ranking points. The ATP uses this data to decide on tournament entry status and seedings, so there is assuredly trust in these metrics by the governing body of tennis as far as evaluating players on tour. "
